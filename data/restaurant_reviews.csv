OMG this place is AMAZING!! üòç Went there for my anniversary and everything was perfect. The steak was cooked exactly how I wanted it and the service was incredible. Sarah (our server) was so attentive. Definitely coming back!,5.0,Sakura House,Japanese,2025-04-25,user_3206,17
"Best thai food I've had since my trip to Bangkok! The pad thai was incredible - not too sweet, perfect spice level. My boyfriend loved the green curry too. Hidden gem for sure üíé",5.0,Riverside Diner,American,2024-12-26,user_6938,17
Love love love this place! Been coming here for 3 years now and it never disappoints. Maria (the owner) always remembers my usual order. The atmosphere is so cozy and romantic. Perfect date spot ‚ù§Ô∏è,5.0,El Coraz√≥n,Mexican,2025-05-18,user_4638,19
Incredible seafood! The lobster was so fresh and perfectly cooked. Yes it's expensive but totally worth it for special occasions. Wine selection is also impressive. Will definitely be back!,5.0,Green Garden Bistro,Vegetarian,2025-08-03,user_3249,21
Amazing brunch spot!! The pancakes are to die for and the eggs benedict is incredible. Coffee is always perfect. Only downside is it gets super crowded on weekends so make a reservation!,5.0,Riverside Diner,American,2025-07-08,user_2072,22
Really good food and nice atmosphere. The steaks are cooked perfectly and the sides are creative. Service is professional but the prices are pretty high. Good for special occasions though.,5.0,Sunny Side Cafe,American,2025-05-23,user_1104,33
Great neighborhood spot! Burgers are juicy and fries are crispy. Staff always remembers the regulars which is nice. Fair prices and good portions. Perfect for casual dinner with friends.,5.0,Pasta Plus,Italian,2025-07-23,user_1432,21
"Solid Italian place. Pasta was good, not amazing but definitely satisfying. Service was friendly and efficient. Would come back but not necessarily my first choice in the area.",4.0,The Breakfast Spot,American,2025-01-22,user_3089,14
"Love the ambiance here - very romantic setting. Food was really good, especially the chicken parmesan. Only complaint is that it can get quite noisy when busy.",4.0,Prime Steakhouse,Steakhouse,2025-03-19,user_7608,7
Good Mexican food! Tacos are authentic and flavorful. Guacamole made fresh at the table is a nice touch. Margaritas could be stronger but overall good experience.,3.0,Local Burger Joint,American,2025-06-11,user_3084,8
Decent food but nothing special. The chicken was okay but a bit dry. Service was adequate but not particularly friendly. Prices are reasonable for portion sizes. It's fine for a quick meal.,3.0,Corner Cafe,American,2024-12-28,user_8492,10
Food was good but service needs improvement. Our server forgot our drink order and we had to ask for condiments multiple times. Food came out hot though. With better service could be 4 stars.,,Downtown Diner,American,2025-08-12,user_5971,40
"Went here twice now... first time was great, second time not so much. Maybe just an off day? Food quality seems inconsistent. The atmosphere is nice though.",3.0,Prime Steakhouse,Steakhouse,2024-11-19,user_1982,9
Meh... expected better based on the reviews. Food was okay I guess but nothing stood out. Service was slow and the restaurant was uncomfortably warm. Probably won't go back.,2.0,Blue Moon Cafe,American,2025-06-09,user_4793,8
Pretty standard american food. Nothing wrong with it but nothing exciting either. Good option if you have kids since they have a decent kids menu.,3.0,Thai Garden,Thai,2025-06-29,user_3016,3
Disappointing visit. The sushi didn't taste fresh and the rice was too warm. Service was slow and inattentive. For the price point I expected much better quality.,3.0,Pasta Plus,Italian,2024-04-21,user_5220,5
Food quality has declined recently. This used to be one of my favorite spots but new management has really changed things. Miss the old menu üò¢,5.0,Sakura House,Japanese,2025-05-01,user_2599,40
Reservation system is broken. Waited 45 minutes WITH a reservation. Food was good when we finally got it but seriously need to fix the wait times.,4.0,Sunny Side Cafe,American,2024-11-05,user_1329,11
Cash only - heads up! Food is decent but who carries cash anymore?? There's an ATM inside but it's still annoying. Food was mediocre anyway.,4.0,Smoky Joe's BBQ,BBQ,2025-04-08,user_7606,39
Way too loud! Couldn't hear my friend across the table. Food was good but the noise level made it impossible to enjoy. Not going back.,5.0,Corner Cafe,American,2025-08-15,user_4746,6
"AVOID AT ALL COSTS! Worst meal ever. Food was cold, service was rude, and the tables were dirty. How is this place still open??? Complete waste of money.",1.0,Maria's Kitchen,Mexican,2025-09-24,user_8959,5
Terrible experience from start to finish. Seated 30 minutes late despite reservation. Appetizers were clearly microwaved and main courses were tasteless. Server seemed annoyed when we asked questions.,1.0,Maria's Kitchen,Mexican,2025-05-31,user_5908,4
Food poisoning! Got sick after eating here. The chicken tasted off but I thought I was being paranoid. Spent the whole next day in bed. Never again.,4.0,The Clock Tower,American,2025-04-20,user_5681,19
Absolutely awful. Ordered delivery and it took 2 hours to arrive cold. Called to complain and they hung up on me. Worst customer service ever.,1.0,Blue Moon Cafe,American,2025-08-02,user_8799,1
Do NOT eat here. Found a hair in my salad and when I told the server they just shrugged. Disgusting. Health department should shut this place down.,1.0,Prime Steakhouse,Steakhouse,2025-08-25,user_9090,6
came here after my daughter's graduation. staff was super accommodating for our large group (12 people!). food came out together which was impressive. definitely recommend for groups.,2.0,Prime Steakhouse,Steakhouse,2025-05-17,user_1351,2
my mom recommended this place and she was right! reminds me of childhood comfort food. portions are huge and prices are fair. will definitely be back.,3.0,Maria's Kitchen,Mexican,2025-05-26,user_6522,0
tried the new location and it's much better than the original. seems like they learned from their mistakes. parking is still terrible though lol,1.0,Casa Miguel,Mexican,2025-03-23,user_6225,3
not sure what the fuss is about... maybe I ordered the wrong thing? the pasta was overcooked and sauce was too salty for my taste. my friend loved her dish though ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,5.0,Ocean's Bounty,Seafood,2025-09-06,user_7364,41
perfect for a quick lunch but wouldn't bring a date here. food is good and fast but atmosphere is very casual. great value for money though!,5.0,The Breakfast Spot,American,2025-06-14,user_7800,40
delivery was surprisingly fast and food was still hot! packaging was good too - nothing spilled. definitely ordering again when I'm too lazy to cook üòÖ,5.0,Tony's Pizza Corner,Italian,2025-06-03,user_3324,49
went here for my birthday dinner and the server surprised me with a free dessert! small touches like that really matter. food was great too.,3.0,The Breakfast Spot,American,2023-10-18,user_4920,4
this used to be my go-to spot but prices have gone up significantly. food is still good but not sure if it's worth the premium anymore.,4.0,Downtown Burger Co,American,2025-04-27,user_4809,27
trendy instagram spot but food actually lives up to the hype! yes it's pricey but the presentation and taste are both on point. great for photos üì∏,4.0,Green Garden Bistro,Vegetarian,2025-05-06,user_3814,5
hole in the wall place that doesn't look like much but the food is incredible! best kept secret in the neighborhood. cash only though.,5.0,Sakura House,Japanese,2025-01-18,user_3052,16
